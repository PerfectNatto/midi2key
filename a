Demucs is a deep learning model for music source separation. It can split a single audio file (e.g., a song) into vocals, drums, bass, and other instruments.

Developed by Facebook AI (Meta AI), it uses a structure similar to U-Net and WaveNet, and processes audio in the time domain rather than the frequency domain. This enables high-quality separation. Newer versions like Hybrid Demucs further improve the performance and accuracy.
